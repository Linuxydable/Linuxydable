# Linuxydable - Indie Game and Graphics Engine Developer. 🐧
### Hello World and Welcome to my GitHub profile ! 🎉




## About me
I'm a indie French developer with 25 years old.

I like working on Games and Engines.
I have learned some Graphics API like Direct3D11, Direct3D12, OpenGL and Vulkan.

Now I'm currently working on a Game Engine called "pireneus" for my future company project [Piereneus Studio](https://github.com/Pireneus-Studio).
This company is specialized about the Game Development, Realtime 3D solutions and Cloud Computing/Gaming.

I'm currently interested with the [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) library for the cross-platform of my Game Engine.


I also use some generalist game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, GameMaker, XNA, Heaps, etc...
I have a speciality about graphics rendering and low level programming.

I have acquired some skills on Unity especially with the [Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)](https://unity.com/dots) and the [Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP)](https://unity.com/srp).
Some samples and code example are available through my repositories.


My renderer code is more like : `// Here be dragons 🐲`
