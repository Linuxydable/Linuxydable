# Linuxydable - Indie Game and Graphics Engine Developer. üê≤




### About me
I'm a indie French developer with 27 years old.
<br>
I'm a developer who loves to create and program video games and especially go tinkering in the low level to touch in game engines as well as in rendering engines.

Founder of [Isabit Studio](https://github.com/Isabit-Studio).<br>
This company specializes in the creation, porting, consulting and publishing of video games, as well as tools to support video game creation, such as a video game engine and Open Source libraries.

I already have the skills and experience to work on general-purpose game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine and GameMaker. But I also have experience in frameworks such as SDL, XNA (MonoGame/FNA), Heaps and Raylib.
