## About me
I'm a indie French developer and I have 23 years old.

I like working on Games and Engines.
I have learned some Graphics API like Direct3D11 and OpenGL.

Now I'm currently working on a Game Engine called [Shattered Engine](https://github.com/Shattered-Devs/ShatteredEngine) and soon will be reworked into the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I'm currently interested with the [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) library for the cross-platform of my Game Engine.


Even if I make my own engine I still using some Engines like Unity, Godot and Unreal Engine.
And I have some great skill on Unity, I can make Custom Render Pipeline, Editor Scripting (Window, Inspector and Graph View) and I'm a DOTS lover !
You can soon view my DOTS and Project Tiny sample repo for Unity. ^^

I'm open for Jobs. ‚úî

Anyway, thank you for viewing my GitHub profile and have a Good Day !
